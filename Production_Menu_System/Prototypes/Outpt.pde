-Multiply two polynomials together										// FFT
-Evaluate a polynomial at a point										// Vandermonde
-Multiply two n-bit integers											// FFT
-Multiply two n by n matrices											// Strassen's 
-O(nlogn), binary search Search an array for an element
-Anything else we have discussed in class
-Anything else that has been on your homework

You should know about Vandermonde Matrices (specifically how we used them in the context of polynomial multiplication). 
You should be able to describe the FFT algorithm as a matrix multiplication.

You should understand Big O notation and know how to prove that f = O(g). // done

You should be able to write arguments regarding the runtime of algorithms you write or use, and you should be able to argue about their correctness as well.

You should know that comparison-based sorting algorithms must make at least nlog(n) comparisons in the worst case, and 
you should understand why the linear-time sorting algorithms we presented are not exceptions to this (there are many reasons).

NOTE: I may augment this announcement before the exam.

Have a great weekend,
