# CS-4911-PipBoy-Project
Pip-Boy 4000 in real life.

This project seeks to implement a student rendition of a Pip-Boy 4000, a newer and more advanced Pip-Boy than the 3000 model. The project consists of hardware and software elements that are wide in scope and are meant for a computer science senior design project. While we feel the project is not hard to reduplicate, we may just not realize how much we have learned. Regardless, basic functionality can be accomplished with an touchscreen and a raspi pi 2.
